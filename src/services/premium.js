45+2' - Away team pressing aggressively. Home keeper makes good save.

42' - Tactical adjustment: Away team brings on fresh midfielder.

Betting Impact:
• Over odds shortened - increased attacking intent
• Defensive lines look susceptible
• Expect more goals in 2nd half

Updated Prediction: Over 2.5 (72% confidence)
