## Summary: Harness & Monitor Runs (Nov 26, 2025)

### Local Harness Run ✅ SUCCESS

- **Timestamp**: Nov 25, 2025 23:45:13 UTC
- **Method**: `node scripts/test-payment-harness.js`
- **Result**: Payment order created, verified, and subscription activated.
- **Output**: Order `ORD99991764114311270` created for PAYPAL; VVIP tier activated with 30-day expiry.

### Local Monitor Run ✅ SUCCESS

- **Timestamp**: Nov 26, 2025 (today)
- **Method**: `node scripts/mapping-miss-monitor.js`
- **Result**: No mapping-miss keys found (healthy state).
- **Output**: Monitor script runs without errors when .env credentials are present.

### GitHub Actions Workflow Runs ❌ BLOCKED

- **Payment Harness Workflow**: Run #2 (ID 19687612832) failed at 2025-11-25T23:47:23Z.
  - **Reason**: Repository billing is locked. GitHub Actions cannot execute jobs until account billing is resolved.
  - **Fix**: Repository owner must resolve billing issue in GitHub Settings > Billing.
- **Mapping-Miss Monitor Workflow**: Hourly scheduled runs triggered (last run ID 19697909514, about 1 hour ago).
  - **Reason**: Same billing lock prevents execution.
  - **Status**: Scheduled workflow is configured to run every hour once billing is fixed.

### What's Deployed

✅ **Code**: All payment router, webhook handlers, PayPal integration, admin endpoints, and monitoring scripts are committed to `main` and ready to run.
✅ **Workflows**: Dispatchable `run-payment-harness.yml` and scheduled `mapping-miss-monitor.yml` workflows are deployed and will execute once billing is resolved.
✅ **Secrets**: All required GitHub Actions secrets set (REDIS*URL, TELEGRAM_TOKEN, PAYPAL*\*, ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID, etc.).
✅ **Tests**: Local unit tests pass (10 tests); local harness runs successfully.

### Next Steps

1. **Resolve Billing** (owner action): Visit https://github.com/settings/billing/summary and fix the account lock.
2. **Re-dispatch Workflows**: Once billing is fixed, dispatch the harness and monitor workflows via:
   ```bash
   gh workflow run run-payment-harness.yml --ref main
   gh workflow run mapping-miss-monitor.yml --ref main
   ```
3. **Monitor Runs**: View logs via `gh run list --workflow="run-payment-harness.yml"` and `gh run view <run-id> --log`.

All code changes are production-ready. Actions execution is the only remaining blocker.
