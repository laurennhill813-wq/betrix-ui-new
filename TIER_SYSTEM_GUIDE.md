## 🔒 Feature Gating Implementation

### How the Bot Controls Access

**When a FREE user tries `/analyze`:**

```
❌ DENIED
Message: "🔒 Professional match analysis available for members"
Action: Show upsell menu with upgrade options
```

**When a MEMBER user tries `/dossier`:**

```
❌ DENIED
Message: "🔒 Professional dossier available for VVIP"
Action: Show upgrade to VVIP button
```

**When a VVIP user tries `/dossier`:**

```
✅ ALLOWED
Response: "📋 PROFESSIONAL MATCH DOSSIER [500+ words]"
Action: Show full premium content
```

---

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Subscription Gatekeeper Service

Located in `src/middleware/subscription-gatekeeper.js`

```javascript
// Check if user can access feature
const hasAccess = await gatekeeper.canAccess(userId, "dossier");

if (!hasAccess) {
  // Show upsell and block feature
  await gatekeeper.enforceAccess(chatId, userId, "dossier");
  return;
}

// Show premium content
```

### Tier-Aware Handlers

Located in `src/handlers-tier.js`

Each command is wrapped with subscription checking:

```javascript
async analysisWithTier(chatId, userId, matchQuery) {
  // Step 1: Check if user has access
  if (!(await this.gatekeeper.enforceAccess(chatId, userId, "analysis"))) {
    return; // Access denied + upsell shown
  }

  // Step 2: Get user tier
  const tier = await this.gatekeeper.getUserTier(userId);

  // Step 3: Provide tier-appropriate response
  if (tier === "vvip") {
    // Show advanced analysis with metrics
  } else if (tier === "member") {
    // Show standard analysis
  }
}
```
